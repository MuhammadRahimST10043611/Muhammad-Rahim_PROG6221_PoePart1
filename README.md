## Running Techniques

To execute the work in Visual Studio, simply comply with the instructions below:

1. Open the file's folder and extract it.
2. Launch Visual Studio.
3. Select `Project/Solution} under `File} -> `Open}.
4. Locate the project folder extraction location by navigating there.
5. Click `Open` after selecting the solution file, which typically ends with the `.sln} extension.
6. To build the project, hit `Ctrl + Shift + B} when the solution has opened.
7. To launch the project, hit {F5} in the end.

And that's it! The project isÂ supposed to be operating in Visual Studio at this point.
